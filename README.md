# Basic-Cave-Mapping-System

Basic-Cave-Mapping-System is composed by two parts:
- the firmware for the Laser distance measurement based on BLENano microcontroller board in the BLENano-IMU-Laser folder
- the Android app (androidOFXspeleo) to receive the data relative to 3D space measurement and control the Laser distance board.

To build and flash the firmware refer to the "Using Arduino" section on the following link:
